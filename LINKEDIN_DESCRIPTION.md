Developed an interactive AI Travel Assistant that creates personalized packing lists based on real-time weather conditions. Built a Flask-based web application that integrates Google's Gemini API for natural language understanding to extract location data and generate tailored travel advice. Implemented OpenWeatherMap API integration to fetch live weather metrics (temperature, conditions) which directly influence the AI's recommendations. Designed a relational database schema using SQLite to persist user sessions, trip details, and chat history, ensuring a seamless user experience. The project demonstrates proficiency in backend development, third-party API orchestration, prompt engineering, and database management.

Key Learning Areas: Python, Flask, REST API Integration (Gemini, OpenWeatherMap), SQLite, Database Design, Prompt Engineering, Session Management, Real-time Data processing
