Upgrades to O:

1. Readme


Hardcoded Secrets in CI: ❌
In test.yml, we wrote fake_key_for_ci. In a real company,
if you accidentally committed a real key there, you'd be in trouble.
(Fix: Use GitHub Secrets).

No Type Hinting: ⚠️
Python is dynamic, but professionals use Type Hints (def foo(a: str) -> int:).
It makes code readable.

Synchronous API Calls: 🐌
requests.get() blocks the server. If OpenWeatherMap takes 5 seconds,
your whole website freezes for everyone.
(Fix: Use aiohttp or Background Tasks like Celery).

Database Scalability: 💾
SQLite locks the file on write. If 100 users try to save a trip at once,
it might crash. (Fix: Use PostgreSQL).

Error Handling (Catch-All): 🐛
except Exception as e: is a bit lazy.
It catches everything (even KeyboardInterrupt).
It's better to catch specific errors (requests.ConnectionError).
